# elibrary
elibrary is a book eshop. Customers can check for books and order them. They can also create an account so that they won't have to insert their information 
every time they make an order. A special page for admin is also included making possible to update book's information or add new books to the database.
The website was created using C#, asp.net.core 6 (razor pages for the eshop) and blazor (for the admin page).
